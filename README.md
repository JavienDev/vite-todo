# Vite + Vue3 To-Do Website

This is a simple to-do website created with Vite using the Vue-Typescript template.


## Contributions:
While this project is mainly for myself as I want to learn front-end development, if you have something that can teach me, please fork the project, implement the change and describe why it should be done this way, or what was wrong with my version of the code.

All I ask is that you keep the commit messages in the style of following:

| Prefix | When to use it |
| ------ | ---------------|
|  init: | For initializing new feature/component |
|  feat: | When adding a new feature |
|  refactor: | When restructuring existing code |
|  chore: | Minor setup, dependencies, or config changes |
|  doc: | When updating README, TODO, comments |
